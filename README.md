# test_app
App to test if Maven, Git and IntelliJ are properly configured

After making sure you properly installed Maven, Git, IntelliJ, please clone this app and run it inside IDEA IntelliJ.

If the app runs successfully and Company objects are serialized and after that deserialized, then you may consider the setup is over.

You only need to add the app from a local machine in a new repo on your personal Github profile.

Congrats!
